# Open Souring Design of Steem mascot, participate to get your reward in Steem Dollars!

#UPDATE:

This is repo where you can submit your files or update mine keeping original version and adding your name of steem account next to yours.

Feel free to fork and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) when you are ready"

Every new variant should be a new file. We need a convention for naming those files. I propose the following:

```
[steemit username]-[number]-steemit-mascot.svg
```

Example:

```
granin-01-steemit-mascot.svg
```

This way we know who is proposing what and people can submit lots of different variants.

Contests must have a timeframe, 31 October 11AM PST will be our hard lock date\time. 

# Why mascot of Steem should be simple enough to be editable by everyone

I’m advocate of open source design, and here is source of my submission to 


I have a cool idea! **Why don’t I make another contest in case my variant wins?** 

I promise to distribute whatever  I win to winners of my new contest, that will follow initial one. Contesters can change the original mascot. Anyone will be able to this as it's just  moving around and resizing of 6 circles. As a result, we will have a lot of different  images with our mascot and really great one to use as a default one. 

1. The mascot should be alive and needs a lot of images with variations of  for one same character to use in different situations (emotions, composition, etc). ​
1. Good design takes time. I don't like contests we had till now just because there is no modification of initial dirty drafts people post for the contest. The final result should be refined. It takes time. 


Why don't we use time of all of the Steemers to it shot such contest ?   

Steemers on our [Telegram chat](https://telegram.me/steem_en) voted for this idea, so **I promise to share my prize between all of you, who will contribute by changing my  initial design, either here or on GitHub** if I win.

Here is version that I created and submitted today:

It consists of only 6 circles that you can rotate to get different moods and we can work on guidelines so anyone can easily get new looks of this character, some now we can edit it with no restrictions and get anything like this:

Making logo of just arcs of a minimum number of circles is a challenge, this is one great example from my colleague, Yury Akulin, who created my own logo and many amazing logos during our 12 years of work in [my  studio](Softideitnty).

Here is what I got from news about logo above”
> out of 36,000 logos sent to the team of LogoLounge, LogoLounge – a collection of the world’s best logotypes – the panel of judges selected top 20. Among the highest ranked 20 logos, there it was: this work is done for FishMarket– a red crab entirely constructed from various circular arcs.

This one was literally chosen by LogoLounge as the best logo of the year!
